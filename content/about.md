Hi there! First of all, welcome to my blog. I'm just an ordinary developer from Kathmandu, Nepal. My experience lies in developing AI-based software solutions. Currently, I'm working as an ML Engineer at [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com), a document-AI company. My day-to-day job involves exploring various ML models for extracting information from documents. In addition to research, I also develop, deploy, and monitor these systems in production.

Before working at Docsumo, I ventured into entrepreneurship while still in college. This chapter of my life deserves a blog post of its own, but until then, I'd like to distill the information into this page. Along with two of my seniors, we tried to build an Upwork-like platform, but tailored for the Nepalese market. Unlike Upwork, our platform focused on blue-collar jobs alongside other services. When we first launched, the community support was overwhelming, and our app made it to the top 10% of Play Store's trending apps. However, strong support alone wasn't enough to keep the project afloat. We were college students with no funds or legal knowledge about running a business.

We quickly found ourselves working on other service-based projects to fuel our startup. We took on gigs from our personal connections and from Upwork itself. The money from these gigs was good, so we gradually shifted focus from our product and started working fully as a consulting and service company. One notable gig was writing data science articles for a large client. This made us see the potential in content writing and delivery, which led us to start [TheClickReader](https://theclickreader.com). We wrote many articles, blogs, and courses specifically for the data science community. 

It turned out to be fairly successful, as compared to our previous venture. We even began creating courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/856c3f66-1301-4601-99aa-73f5c9dbd619/). However, while writing content was fun, it wasnâ€™t what I wanted to pursue as a career. I was still young and in my undergrad, and I wanted to explore more on the tech side of things. So, I made the decision to part ways with TheClickReader and join Docsumo.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
