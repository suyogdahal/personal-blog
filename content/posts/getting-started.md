## Hello to Everyone Reading This,

It's been quite a while since I last penned anything down. The last memory I have of writing was during my GRE's [Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)](https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers/general-test/prepare/content/analytical-writing.html) — ah, the good ol' days! But let’s set the jokes aside for a moment. I used to write articles and courses for [The Click Reader](https://theclickreader.com) for over a year. However, after moving on from Click Reader, my writing habits took an unexpected hiatus. It's been over two and a half years since then, and my journey with words came to an abrupt stop.

Back in those days at The Click Reader, I was an undergraduate student, quite naive about how things work in the real world. My writing was mostly inspired by articles and courses I had read myself. It had little to no personal touch or experience attached to it. Fast forward to today, I’ve spent over two and a half years working at [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com) as an ML Engineer. I've gained some experience and insights that I believe would be useful to others. To be perfectly honest, I am a tad frustrated with my current state of having no side projects outside of work. Moreover, preparing for grad school applications while working full-time has been quite draining.

I need a fresh start to maintain my sanity, so I’ve decided to revisit an old hobby — writing. Writing was incredibly therapeutic for me, even though it required countless hours of reviews to polish each piece into something publishable. But now, with the emergence of generative models, things should be much smoother. My goal is to write at least one article regularly. Regularity is something I struggle with, whether it be fitness motivation or Leetcode sprees, so this will be a personal challenge for me.

My writings will primarily focus on Machine Learning, Python, and Cloud technologies, though I might explore other intriguing topics as well. If you’ve made it this far into my brain-dump, thank you for your patience and interest.

Stay tuned for more content — I promise to do my best not to disappoint you!
