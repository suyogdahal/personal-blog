This chapter of my life deserves a blog post of its own, but until then, I’d like to distill the information into this page. Along with two of my seniors, we tried to build an Upwork-like platform, but tailored for the Nepalese market. Unlike Upwork, our platform focused on blue-collar jobs alongside other services.

We took on gigs from our personal connections and from Upwork itself. The money from these gigs was good, so we gradually shifted focus from our product and started working fully as a consulting and service company. One notable gig was writing data science articles for a large client. This made us see the potential in content writing and delivery, which led us to start TheClickReader. We wrote many articles, blogs, and courses specifically for the data science community.\nIt turned out to be fairly successful, as compared to our previous venture. We even began creating courses on Udemy. However, while writing content was fun, it wasn’t what I wanted to pursue as a career.
